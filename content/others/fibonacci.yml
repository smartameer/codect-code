    Program is to return Nth number of fibonacci's sequence
    Fibonacci sequence is characterized by the fact, every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones
    e.g. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
code:
    Javascript: |
        function fibonacci (n) {
            if (n > 97) {
                throw 'Input too large, results in inaccurate fibonacci value.';
            }
            var n1 = 0,
                n2 = 1,
                aux;

            while (n > 0) {
                aux = n1;
                n1 = n2;
                n2 += aux;
                n = n - 1;
            }

            return n1;
        }

        var nth = fibonacci(20);
        console.log(nth); // 6765
